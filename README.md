# 2D-Self-Avoiding-Walk

Made with P5.js

An attempt to make a self avoiding walk.
Minor problems, errors occure when walker gets stuck or falls of the canvas in second commit

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-avoiding_walk check out the wikipedia page about the concept.

Now after third commit I think, I want to implememt a BACKTRACKING ALGORITHM....
